# Documentation for calmmindbot.ipynb

The `calmmindbot.ipynb` notebook is designed to create a mental health counseling chatbot using OpenAI's API. Below is a detailed explanation of the tasks and code within the notebook:

---

## **Key Features**

- **Data Processing**: Structures raw data into a format suitable for OpenAI's API.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Prepares and fine-tunes a model for mental health counseling.
- **Testing**: Validates the fine-tuned model's performance.

## **Notebook Overview**

This notebook is structured into multiple tasks to guide the development of the chatbot. It includes sections for installing dependencies, importing libraries, creating classes, loading and processing data, and fine-tuning the model.

---

### **Task 1: Install Packages**

- Installs required Python packages such as `ipykernel`, `openai`, and `datasets` using pip commands.
- Ensures the environment is set up for running the notebook and interacting with OpenAI's API.

---

### **Task 2: Import the Libraries**

- Imports essential libraries:
  - `os`: For file and directory operations.
  - `openai`: To interact with OpenAI's API.
  - `datasets`: For loading and processing datasets.
  - `enum`: To define enumerations for roles.
  - `random`: For sampling data.
  - `json`: For handling JSON data.

---

### **Task 3: Create Classes for the Dataset**

- **RoleType Enum**: Defines user roles (`USER`, `SYSTEM`, `ASSISTANT`) for the chatbot.
- **Role Class**: Represents a role with its type and content.
- **Message Class**: Combines roles into a structured message format for OpenAI's API.

---

### **Task 4: Load, Explore, and Store the Data**

- Loads a dataset of mental health counseling conversations using the `datasets` library.
- Creates sample `Message` objects to structure the data for OpenAI's API.
- Samples 100 items from the dataset and processes them into a training dataset.
- Saves the processed data in JSONL format for training and validation.

---

### **Task 5: Fine-Tune the Model**

- Prepares the training and validation data for fine-tuning OpenAI's model.
- Includes placeholders for adding the OpenAI API key, uploading data, and creating fine-tuning jobs.

---

### **Task 6: Test the Fine-Tuned Model**

- Tests the fine-tuned model by creating and storing message dictionaries.
- Compares the output of the fine-tuned model with the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

## **Files in the Data Folder**

1. **`train.jsonl`**: This file stores the training dataset in JSONL format, which is used to fine-tune the chatbot model. Each line in the file represents a JSON object containing structured data for training.

2. **`validation.jsonl`**: This file contains the validation dataset in JSONL format, used to evaluate the chatbot model's performance during fine-tuning. Each line represents a JSON object for validation.

This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for building and fine-tuning a mental health counseling chatbot.

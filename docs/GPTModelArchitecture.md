# GPT Model Architecture

## ðŸ§  GPT Model Architecture â€“ Key Components

The architecture of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models consists of the following core components:

- **Embedding Layer**  
  Converts input tokens into high-dimensional vector representations for further processing.

- **Positional Encoding**  
  Injects positional context into embeddings so the model can understand the order of words in a sequence.

- **Transformer Encoder Blocks**  
  A stack of self-attention layers and feedforward neural networks that analyze relationships between tokens across the input context.

- **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**  
  Ensure stable training and efficient gradient flow, allowing deeper networks to learn effectively.

- **Output Layer**  
  Generates probability distributions over the vocabulary to predict the next token in the sequence.

Together, these components enable GPT models to generate fluent, context-aware responses from natural language prompts. Let me know if you'd like a diagram or code snippet for illustration!
